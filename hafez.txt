In the shadow of your leisure property My poem is open to the praise of Yemen in a hundred kingdoms It is as if I speak your tongue On Golshani, if I pass, what will happen in the morning Reed was the love of cypress and not the passion of my spruce I could smell you and remember you The butlers gave me a couple of sagars Drunkenness to water is not a matter of a couple I'm an old man growing up Enough judging with the starry sky I will help Shah Bad's fairness in this story Thank God that the court is open at this peak The peacock of the throne hears the sound of Shahparam My name is from the factory of lovers If it was other than your love, my other job Shebl al-Assad attacked my heart and I If I am thin, otherwise I will hunt furiously O lovers, more than a particle on you When I draw, I am less than a particle Tell me who denies your good face Until I see it, I will be jealous of Ghazalk The shadow of the sun reigned on me And now I'm free from the sunrise The purpose of this transaction is marketing I sell straws and I buy straws   Why not pursue the determination of my country Why not be the dust on my friend's dormitory I do not like strange sorrow and homelessness I will go to my city and be my prince I will be hidden from the secrets I am a servant of my Lord Because the work of life is not obvious, it's the first time To be my forerunner on the day of the event Lucky expensive sleep and messy work It was hot to be my secret herd My profession has always been love and randy I will try again and be busy with my work Was to be guided by the grace of eternity, Hafiz Otherwise, I will be ashamed forever   The light on your candle turned into a butterfly Do not take care of me with your condition Wisdom that bound the free to love You went crazy with the smell of violets What happened to the smell of your hair if your soul was blown away Dear thousand lives I lost my footing with zeal I saw myself as a stranger What plans we came up with and it didn't work Our charm has become a legend to him On the fire his beautiful face instead of Sepand Except for the black spot that he saw on the seed Gave the good news to Saba the good news From the candle on you when the butterfly arrived I love a pact around my lips That I do not speak except the hadith of Peymaneh Hadith of the school and the house Do not say that it is open Fatad in the head of the pub air guard   Forty years have passed since I bragged I am the least of the old Moghan chakras Never sell old feelings to Yemen Saghar did not empty From the place of love and the government of Rendan Pakbaz I was always at the top of the stairs Do not suspect me of suffering I was clothed, but I was clean Shahbaz, what is the state of my king?

I will draw a curtain on the eunuch's feast Turansheh is blessed that Yazid Fazl is in me I was blessed with a necklace   So much so that I said grief with the doctors They did not treat the poor strangers The flower that is in every hand Shame on the wind from Andaliban Or spare the Lord to review Loving eyes on lovers Insertion of love is not on your seal Or Lord lest com rivals O last blessing on Juan Judet How many of us are unlucky Hafiz did not return the mania of the universe If you listen to the advice of writers   Why were you so kind in the heart of that month?  That we were not like that or you were like that Tell me how much Nasim Torah is worth You were warm to every hair of a thousand souls You's happy, how low you are or paste You were safe from bad times You were proud of the hot weather and dear You were the bed of my honor in that land of Astan I wish you came out of the curtain with tears We saw that his sentence was valid If not, close the circle of love You were confused about Hafiz point   What a grace it was to suddenly see your pen He offered us the right to serve You have figured on the tip of the cream. Hello That the factory of the time was worthless I'm not saying you forgot me by heart Which is not in the account of wisdom, inadvertently on your pen Do not humiliate me thanks to this blessing Dear and respected Sarmad government Come on, I'll be stubborn If I lose my mind, I will not be old Let our hearts be informed except when When Laleh was taken from the soil of the slain Find our thirsty psyche in a sip Choo give clear Khedr from Jam Jamat May your time be always happy, Jesus Saba When the heartbroken Jan Hafez was resurrected   I do not know how drunk he brought us Who was the butler and where did this wind come from You too catch the wind and make your way to the desert That brought the songwriter chicken to a good start Do not complain about the heart of the bud That morning wind brought a knot untying Good luck to Gol and Nasrin Banafsheh was happy and Saman Safa came Saba is the good news of Hudhud Suleiman Who brought the good news of Tarb from Golshan Saba The cure for the weakness of our heart is charcoal The doctor came and brought medicine The old disciple of Moghanam, I am the shepherd of Sheikh Because you made your promise and he kept it To the narrow eyes of that tender army When the dervish attacked me, he brought a goat The sky of Hafez's slavery is now in full swing That plea to bring in your government   When the sun rises from the east of the cup From the garden of the butler, a thousand tulips come out The breeze breaks on the flower head The smell of that stigma wafts through the grass The story of the night of Hojran is not the story of the present That a part of his expression will reach a hundred treatises There can be no greed from the astronomer That a hundred sorrows of one lament will arise without boredom You can not find the essence of the purpose by your own efforts Imagine for a second you were transposed into the karmic driven world of Earl Gareth Cho, the prophet Noah, is patient in the grief of the flood Let the plague return and the millennium come The breeze of your wind when it passes to Torbat Hafez One hundred thousand tulips grow from the soil of his body  I will decide to go to Koi Yar. I will doubt the smell of its pleasant smell Life goes on in vain and beloved I will work in vain from today Every reputation I have gained from knowledge and religion I will write the soil for it When my morning candle was lit, his seal was lit. I will do this for the rest of my life I will ruin myself in memory of your eyes I will establish the Old Testament Where is Saba, where did this bloody soul come from? I will sacrifice my hair Do not forgive hypocrisy and splendor I will choose through Randy and love   Chou broke Saba Zulf Anbrafshansh Every time he joined, his life was renewed Where is the soul to offer the description What a heartbreak from the days of his humiliation Time has closed on you from the example of a flower petal But out of shame, he hid it in a bud You are asleep and love has not appeared on the shore Blessed be God, because there is no end to it The beauty of the Kaaba will flow except for an excuse That the heart of the heart burned alive in its desert With this broken house of sorrow that comes What is the sign of Yusuf Del's wife? I will take that head and hand it to the eunuch That fuel the heartless Hafiz from his cunning and hands   When you hear the words of the people, do not say that it is wrong O speaker, no, my dear, this is a mistake My head does not sink into the world and the back Blessed be God from these seditions that are in our heads I'm tired inside, I do not know who That I am silent and he is in a frenzy and in a commotion My heart came out of the curtain, where are you, Motarb? Banal Han, which is new to our work from this curtain I never paid attention to the work of the world I like your face so much in my opinion I have not eaten from the imagination that cooks my heart I have a hangover for a hundred nights. Where is the winery? As the monastery was polluted with the blood of my heart Wash warm in the wind right in your hand They have long loved it That fire that does not die is always in our hearts What instrument did he play on the screen? Omar is gone and his nose is still full of air They called your love inside last night Hafez's chest space is still full of sound   When my wife puts her hand on her shoulder, I ask for reconciliation Watch the new moon of the poor Zand goes to the corner of his eyebrows and in a mask Wine night spoils me to wake up And if I complain in a day, he will fall asleep The path of love is chaotic and sedition, O heart Let it accelerate in this way Begging in Janan to the king Someone goes to the sun in the shadow of this door Black hair literacy because it is over Do not reduce the white if one hundred choices are made When the bubble blows, the wind of arrogance enters the head His hat goes into the wine Get rid of the veil on your way, Hafiz Blessed is he who walks in this way without hijab   Choo Sarv, if you buy it, give me a flower.  Eat every thorn flower on you with zeal From blasphemy in every circle and chaos From the dawn of your eyes in every corner and disease Do not sleep, my lucky eye, my drunken eye Which is followed by awakening from every suite Sacrifice the soil to criticize my soul though That is not a mental critique on you to some extent Della is always a boast of lovers Chou Tire Rai Shui Ki Goshaidet Kari I lost my mind and it did not take long I was heartbroken and you were not sad I told him the point in the middle of the circle He said with a laugh, Oh, Hafiz, what a mess.   Chu flowers every tail to the boit in clothes I chuck from the wrist to the skirt He saw you blooming in the garden Chou Mastan, take off your clothes I'm getting rid of grief, John But you took my heart away from me According to the enemies, you came back from a friend Let no one be the friend of the enemy You are in the clothes because in the wind cup Your heart in your chest because in iron wire Bring a candle of tears from bloody eyes That burned your heart on the bright creation Do not kiss my chest oh liver Such smoke rises through the hole It breaks my heart and sets me on my feet Which is housing in your head Because your heart is closed in your pocket, Hafiz In this way, he kicks his work   When I'm done, the soil will let go of me Let me tell you to turn my heart away from me The colorful surface makes everyone look like a flower Let me tell you, they covered me I closed my eyes and said, Look at the last comment. He said you want to, unless he bleeds from me He is thirsty for my blood and I am on his lips until he is Get rid of him or get rid of me If Farhadam comes out bitterly, he is not afraid Many sweet anecdotes remain open from me If I go to the candle, he will smile sadly I'm angry because I'm thin My dear friends, look at his mouth Koo to something brief because it stays open to me Wait, Hafiz, if you are saddled, a lesson of sorrow Love in every corner sang a legend from me   Far be it from me to leave in the flowering season I boast of wisdom when to do this Where is Motarb so that all the products of asceticism and science I do not play the harp and sing I was heartbroken by the gossip of school I also serve my beloved a few times Who was bringing the cup in the time of Wafa Until I tell the story of Jam and Kavous Do not be afraid of the black letter on the Day of Judgment By his grace, let me go through a hundred of this letter Koo courier in the morning until the night flocks part I will find auspicious fortune with it This is the borrowed soul that he gave to Hafiz, friend One day I will see Rakhsh and surrender to him   It's not the result of the workplace and the place.

Let's ask unless we find ammunition Keep your face water on every drop The need to go to the judge of needs  and throw turbulent water in the golden bowl Before you know it, throw the bowl on the head of the soil The end of our house is their silent valley Now roaring in the dome of the planet The contaminated eye is far from Janan's face Look at the mirror on his face To your green head, O cypress, if I become dust Cute from the head of coriander and shadow on this soil Break our hearts from the snake on your back Throw opium from your lips to the hospital The property of this farm is not stable Fire from the liver of the cup in the estate I bathed in tears, lazy to say the way Get clean first and then clean on it Or the Lord of that selfish ascetic who saw nothing but fault Smoke flickers in the perceptual mirror Hafiz, because of the flower from his neck Wayne Quba is agile in that way   Has the world of complete victory of Khosrow Din Yahya bin Muzaffar, the king of the just world O door of Islam, your refuge is open On the ground the hole of life and in the heart Your bowing to the soul and wisdom is obligatory and necessary Your reward is good for you and your place and includes The eternal day of your trick is a black drop It fell on the fog that solved the problems Sun Chu saw that black spot and said to his heart O pine, I was that former Hindu The king of the sky is in your dance and listening to your feast Tarb hand from the skirt of this whisper flies You drink and give the world that comes from your belly button Became a malicious neck caught in a series The constellation is based on the method of justice Be happy that the tyrant of the battle way home Hafiz Ghalam Shah Jahan is the divider of sustenance Do not make false thoughts out of livelihood   I'm complaining so much about her black hair That I have become so disorganized from him that you ask One should not leave one's heart and religion in the hope of fidelity I'm so sorry to ask you To one sip that does not bother anyone I bother to ask ignorant people Ascetic, pass us by safely He loses his heart and religion as you ask Dialogue is the way to die Anyone with a cart indicates that you are asking I was pious and healthy, but The narcissist who asks you does something I said I asked the celestial sphere He said, I'll pull it in the polo bow you ask. I told him to break the blood The keeper of this story is long to the Quran that you ask   I'm hoping for an emotional friend I committed a crime and I hope for his forgiveness I know that he will pass over my crime that he Although he is a parishioner, he is an angel I cried so much that everyone came back In our tears, when he saw Ravan, he said, What is Cain? There is no mouth and no sign of him There is hair in it and I do not know what it is I'm surprised by the role of his imagination, because he did not go I have seen him wash his hair from time to time Without a word, Zulf will take your heart Talk to you soon and keep up the good content I'm old enough to hear the smell of your hair The smell in my heart was still there Hafiz is bad, but you are upset Do not be disturbed by the smell of Zelf Yar  The skirts were also draped in drinking For a hundred months, he has torn his wallet out of his pocket He is surrounded by fire Because drops of dew dripped on the flower petals Eloquent eloquent sweet tall agile Beautiful face, beautiful eyes Ruby of the increase of Lotfzadeh water Shamshad is well-bred in Naz That charming pearl between the tub of laughter heart chaos He likes to go to the bathtub That black-eyed deer came out of our trap Friends, what can I do with this heart? Zanhar to the power of the people of Mazar The world is not faithful, O light of both How long will I miss you? Make a charity one day, my dear friend If Hafez was upset because of his honor Again, when we repented of what was said and heard Thank you very much for being a servant of Khajeh If it falls, I have received that fruit   You know what the harpsichord and the oud say Hide the wind that they punish They honor the love and prosperity of lovers Young flaws and old age blame Except for the dark heart, nothing was achieved and still is False in the thought that they are elixirs They say do not say the secret of love and do not sing The problem is the story they tell We have been out of pride a hundred deceptions What do they plan inside the curtain Anxiety when old Moghans give open These seekers are watching what they do with old age One hundred properties can be bought in half The good ones are to blame for this deal An ethnic group made an effort to connect a friend Other ethnic groups refer to fate In general, do not trust the stability of Dehr Cain is a factory that changes Eats that Sheikh, Hafiz, Mufti and Muhtasib Because look good, everyone is cheating   Do you know what a government is? Begging Khosravi in his dormitory It was easy to be greedy, but It's difficult to cut from Johnny's friends I will be close because the bud is sad One place to tear a shirt with a good name Shitting like a breeze with a secret flower Hear the flirtatious shit from the nightingales Do not kiss the lips of the first friend Boredom of the hands and lips Opportunity to talk about this two-way house Because we can no longer reach each other It is as if Hafez left the memory of Shah Yahya Or the Lord reminds me to raise a dervishes   In the beginning, the beam of goodness was manifested. Love was found and fire set on the whole world The Kurdish man did not have the appearance of love It was the fire of this zeal and struck Adam Wisdom wanted that goat to light that flame The lightning of zeal shone and shook the world The plaintiff wanted to come to watch the secret The unseen hand came and hit the non-mahram on the chest Others drew lots for everyone It was our sad heart that was also sad Jan Alavi longed for the well of your wife His hand bent inside the ring Hafiz wrote your love song that day That pen struck the heart of the object   In the beginning, everyone was cheap by the grace of the government Forever Cup was meant to be Johnny's companion I repented as soon as I asked I said this horn was a burden of regret I made myself cuff the rug like a lily on the shoulder Such a flower on a colored cloak was Muslim I can not sit without a cup in solitude Zan that the corner of the heart must have been luminous Do not seek the supreme endeavor of the glorious cup Rand was a novel ruby juice Although it seems messy, our work is easy to see Kander was the beggar of Rashk Soltani Talk to him's good name The selfishness of my soul was an argument of ignorance Anas and Bahar Assembly and poetry discussion in between Not missing the May Cup was a costly affair Di Azizi said that Hafez eats wine secretly My dear, it was not a flaw that was hidden   In this day and age, a friend who is empty-handed Sarahi is pure and the ship is the sonnet The newspaper has a narrow passage of safety Cup holder that dear Omar is irreplaceable No, I'm bored with inaction in the world The boredom of the scholars is also inactive from science In the eyes of reason in this chaotic passer-by The world and the work of the world is unstable and out of place Get a face and a story Which is the influence of Venus and Saturn My heart had high hopes to connect with you But the deadline is the lifetime of Amal's secret They will never find his consciousness As our guardian is drunk from the beginning   In the ruins of Moghangar pass again The result of a cloak and a flowing rug The penitent circle today is my wife The capacitor does not open again tomorrow Give a butterfly to Bali I did not fly except for a candle I do not want to talk about whore, which was the same as negligence In your opinion, if I deal with someone else Hide your longing in your chest If you do not reveal your secret, my dear I looked like a chicken out of an air dust cage In the air, unless he catches it, he is my master Do not put such a grip on my heart Let me play one breath from my lips The story of a bloody heart, not to mention with anyone Zan, who is nothing but a razor of sorrow, I make someone If any hair on the body is protected I will make everyone old like this   I see the light of God in the ruins of Moghan I wonder what light I see from where Appearance on me, O Malik Al-Hajj, that you You see the house and I see the house of God I want to untie your navel The thought is far away as soon as I see the mistake Burning tears of tears oh dawn moaning night I see all this in your favor Every time I play a role on you, the way of imagination By that I say what I see in this curtain No one has seen the musk of khotan and nafeh china What I see every morning from Saba Friends, do not memorize gameplay flaws That I see him as your lover   In Deir Moghan came Yarm Qadhi in hand Drunk from May and drunk from Narges Drunk In Samand's horseshoe he found a new form of fog And his tall stature above the spruce post Finally, what can I say, I know about myself because it is not And no matter what I say, I do not agree with him The candle of the heart-warming sat down as he rose And the Afghan arose from the watchmen, and sat down If the carpet was fragrant, it was wrapped in her hair He turned his bow and joined his eyebrows Once again, Hafez is alive Although the arrow should not be fired from the thumb   He had gone to Moghan's house and got water The old man sat down and prayed to the sheikh Their style is all about slavery But he left the head of the umbrella on the nebula The radius of the cup and the moonlight cup are covered The mourning of the sunburned mourners Lucky bride in that booth with thousands of cute Broken stalks and rose petals Taken from Saghar Ishrat, the Angel of Mercy A sip on the face of a whore and a rose The passion of the stewardess witnesses Broken sugar, poured semolina, rubbed I greeted him and he smiled at me O poor man who has drunk wine That this is what you did to the weakness of your efforts and votes The treasure of the house has been destroyed Do not be afraid of the awake government carpenter That you are asleep in the arms of luck Let me present it to you A thousand lines of answered prayers The constellation of Janiba is Shah Nasreddin Come and see his property on the pedal Wisdom that inspires the unseen in order to gain honor From the roof of the throne, a hundred kisses hit him   In the reign of the king the criminal address Hafiz was killed and the mufti drank a cup A Sufi sat in the corner of the monastery with his legs bent Until the accountant sees that Cebu is carrying a shower The condition of the sheikh and the judge and their drinking I asked the morning question of the old man selling It is not possible to say no, even if it is confidential Understand the language and hold the curtain and drink The butler arrives in the spring and leaves Think that the blood of the heart came from grief to boiling It is love and bankruptcy and youth and spring Excuse me and wear the cream under the cream Make a few candles like that The butterfly is meant, O silent lover O king of face and meaning like you Ignored no seen and heard no ear Stay long enough to accept the cloak Lucky youth from the old ragged sky   In our opinion, the ignorant are astonished I seem to know them The wise are the point of the compass, but Love knows that they are wandering in this circle I am not alone in seeing the appearance of his face The moon and the sun rotate in the same mirror Our covenant was closed with the sweet lips of God We are all servants and this people is God We are bankrupt and we have a hot weather Oh, if they do not pledge the woolen cloak The sun does not reach the amphibian In which the experts are astonished Boasting of love and flocking from the string boast of lying Lovers deserve such embarrassment But your black eyes learn to work Not everyone can be mysterious and drunk If you take the ghosts to your nostrils, you will smell The intellect and the soul are the essence of the universe Zahed Ar Randi does not memorize what happened The demon escapes from the people who read the Qur'an If they become aware of our thoughts, they will be confused After this, the Sufi cloak was not taken hostage   I remembered your eyebrows in prayer There was a situation when the altar was shouted I am now greedy for patience, heart and intelligence The tolerance that you saw was all blown away The wind cleared and the grass birds got drunk The season of love and work was founded I smell the improvement of the world situation Joy brought flowers and Saba wind came happy O bride of art, do not complain about luck Hijleh Hassan Biarai when the groom came Vegetable charmers all wore ornaments Our darling who came with Hassan Khodadad Under the rain the trees that belong Blessed is the servant who came free from the burden of sorrow Sing the words of Hafez Ghazali Naghz To say that I remembered the era of Tarbam   I am happy in Ishrat Sanami's hideout I have a goat's head and a shining horseshoe in the fire I love and rand and eats loudly Wayne, I have all the positions of that prostitute If you have my hand in the saddle I'm confused by the magic of Zelf If such a face opens the rust line of a friend I have a bloody yellow face If you step into Rendan's house I am quoting the poem of Shokrin and Mayb Navak grieve and bring me that I block wars with a wounded heart Hafiz, because the sorrow and joy of the world are passing by It's better that I enjoy myself   It ' s not all late, Moghan, because I'm mad The cloak is somewhere in the wind and the office is somewhere The heart, which is the mirror of the king, has dust I ask God to speak clearly I have repented at the hands of Sanam Badeh That I will not eat anymore Narges boasted about the way your eyes mingled Do not follow the view of the blind The description of this story is only in the language of candles He does not have a license to speak I have closed the atmosphere from sight to lap, unless Let the upper three sit next to me Bring the ship to the wind that my faceless friend Patrol every corner of the eye from the sorrow of the sea's heart Do not speak to me, my lover He and I do not care about anyone What a welcome addition to this hadith that Sahargah said A door with a daf and a scary reed If a Muslim is from Hafiz Oh, if he was looking for today, tomorrow   In the fulfillment of your love, I am famous, I wish you a candle Soldiers dormitory at night and my reindeer chow candle I do not sleep day and night to the sad eyes Enough of crying in Hojr's disease My string of patience was extended to grief I still burn candles in the fire of your love If you were not the amount of my rosy tears, I would be warm When did you become clear to Giti, my hidden secret, like a candle In the midst of water and fire you are still entertained It's my heart's desire to shed tears Send me a butterfly on the night of Hojran Let me not burn the world out of your pain like a candle The beauty of the world of votes in my day is like night With the fullness of your love, at the same time, I lost my candle The mountain of my patience softened because the wax was in the hand of sorrow I melt in the water and fire of your love like a candle Like this morning, one breath remains with your visit Make a face, sweetheart, until my soul shines like a candle Rejoice one night from your connection, sweetheart To be enlightened, I saw a candle from your porch The fire of your love has taken over Hafiz Ajab When I saw the fire of my heart, I sat down in the water and lit a candle   Open the door to the weary heart. Let it flow in the dead body again Let the difference in my eyes close so much That the conquest of the door of union, unless it opens The sorrow that touched the heart of the king like a bell I lost my happiness again To the mirror of the heart of everything I have It does not look open except in the imagination Know that the night is pregnant with the day of you I count the stars until the night is over Come on, Hafiz, the pleasant nightingale It sings open to the smell of your connected flower   Show me a tree of friendship that will bear fruit . Break the seedlings of an enemy that has suffered innumerable times If you are a guest of ruin, be honored with Rendan Jana Garrett got drunk The night speaks of the booty that follows our times Turn around a lot, turn around a lot and eat lunch Amari Dar Lily, who is the cradle of the moon Put God in his heart to pass on the insane O spring, you want life, otherwise this grass every year Chou Nasrin grinds a hundred flowers and a thousand flours like a nightingale I was bound by God because of my beard Tell Lal Nooshin to come soon In this garden, God will protect Hafiz Sit on the lip and survey next to the flour   I have suffered the pain of love that you ask me I have tasted the poison of Hijri that you ask me I've been in the world and the end I have chosen a sweetheart to ask It's so in the air I've seen water go and ask I shower my ears from his mouth I heard you ask me What do you say to me? I bit Lali's lip to ask Without you in your begging cottage I have suffered so much that you ask me Such a strange keeper in the path of love I have reached a position where you ask   It's not our pain to cure al-Ghias Our Hijr is not the end of Ghias They took religion and heart and intended to die الغیاث از جور خوبان الغیاث At the cost of a life-kissing kiss Do these lovers of Ghias These infidels ate our blood O Muslims, what a cure for al-Ghias Such a keeper of day and night without self I am burning and crying   My pain is from my friend and so is the treatment His heart was sacrificed and so was his life That they say it is better than Hassan Our friend has this and that too Remember that wind for the sake of our blood He broke the covenant and so did the covenant Friends on the screen say the word It will be said to the hands as well Because the government came on connected nights Let the days of misery pass too Both worlds have a light on him I told you to find and hide Do not trust the work of the world But also on the revolving wheel The lover is not afraid of the judge But also from the court The accountant knows that Hafez is in love And also Asif Malek Suleiman   I do not stop asking for my mouth to come out Either the body reaches the soul or the soul comes out of the body Open my tomb after death and look The fire inside the smoke comes out of the shroud Show that you are in a mood to be amazed Open your lips so that the man and woman can shout The soul is on the lips and the regret in the heart is from his lips He did not take any breath to get out of the body He missed his mouth with regret How can the poor come out of their mouths? It is said that mentioning his goodness in many lovers Wherever Hafez's name appears in the forum  You can't put your hand in that ring. You can not rely on your covenant and the wind of Saba What I am trying to ask you for It is so much that it is impossible to change the irony A friend's skirt fell into a hundred blood The enemy can not be left to fuss Its complication can not be described as the celestial moon The relationship of a friend to any idiot can not be My head is high when it comes to hearing What a place for clothes that can not be made A clean comment can see Janan's face Which can not be commented on in the mirror except clearly The problem of love is not in the boredom of our knowledge This point can not be solved by thinking wrong Jealousy of cultivating that world-famous but Day and night the chariot can not be created by God What can I say that you have a delicate tenderness To the extent that it is impossible to pray slowly Except for your eyebrows, the altar of Hafez's heart is not Obedience other than you can not be done in our religion   He took my heart away from me and hid his face from me God bless this game Our lonely night was about John His mind did infinite favors Why not be like the bloody tulip of the heart That Narges he made fun of us I say that with this burning pain My doctor intended to kill the disabled It burned like a candle on me Sarahi cried and barked Sabagar, the solution is time That the pain of my longing intended to die Who can be said among the kind? That our friend said so and did so You did not do it with the soul of Hafiz That arrow shot us in the eye  The heart is the veil of his love Seen is the mirror of his fortune I do not understand My neck is under his load You and Touba and us and Qamat Yar Everyone thinks as much as he does What if I have a dirty skirt? The whole world is a witness to his infallibility Who am I in that shrine that Saba The veil is the sanctity of his sanctity Don't worry about the view of the eyes Zan that this corner is his private place Every new flower that became a lawn It is the effect of the color and smell of his speech Mad time has passed and it is our turn Everyone's turn is five days The kingdom of love and the treasure of Tarb Everything I have is from Yemen What a heartbreak I and Delgar sacrificed The purpose is in the midst of his health Poverty ostensibly reveals that Hafiz The chest is the treasure of his love   Our hearts are empty around the grass. Chou is adhering to the cypress and Chou has a hot tulip Our heads descend to the arch of someone's eyebrows Which is empty inside the corners of the world I swing from the violet that blows from her neck In black, you see what is in your nose Look at the grass and look at the flower bed that is a tulip Nadim Shah, who is on the floor of Ayagh, stayed Where to reach the night of darkness and desert Unless the candle is visible to the eye Let me and the morning candle cry That we have burned and our idol is empty of us I cried like an avalanche to cry on this grass Look at the nightingale that has a raven The lesson of love is Hafez's aching heart Which is neither for watching nor for the garden air   My heart is in the air on Farrokh It was as messy as Farrokh's hair There is no one except the Hindu Zalfash Which was enjoyed by Farrokh Black is fortunate that it is permanent Was both Farrokh and his knees Be free because of the trembling willow If he sees Farrokh's comforting height Give the butler purple wine In memory of Narges Jadavi Farrokh My height was like a bow Continuous grief like Farrokh's eyebrows The breeze embarrassed the Tatar musk Shamim Zolf Anbarboi Farrokh If everyone's heart desires It was my heart's desire for Farrokh I am the slave of Hemmat Choo Hafiz Bandeh and Hindu Farrokh  The heart goes out of the hand of the owner of God's heart Pain that the secret will be hidden openly Our ship is broken, wind up Let's review the familiar meeting Ten days of Mehr Gardoon is a legend and a charm Nikki instead of Yara's opportunity counters In the ring of flowers and melons sang the nightingale shower هات الصبوح هبوا یا ایها السکارا O owner of the thankful dignity of health One day, visit the incompetent dervishes The comfort of two universes is the interpretation of these two letters With tolerant friends with enemies They did not pass our name in Nik Koi If you do not like it, change the irony The bitterness that the Sufi called Umm Al-Khabaith Ashhi Lena and Ahli from the qibla of mourning When in poverty, in luxury and drunkenness Cain alchemy is the beggar of the universe Do not be rebellious so that it burns like a candle of zeal Sweetheart with wax on her floor Look at the mirror of Alexander the Great It has a property status for you Good Persian speakers are the givers of life Give the butler the good news of Rendan Parsa Hafiz, do not wear this cloak O chaste sheikh, forgive us   My heart and religion became and my lover was rebuked He said, Go and sit down with us. When you heard that he had a good time at this party Who did not regret it at the end of the conversation Candle if Zan smiled lips in Luffy tongue Compensate to your lovers at night In the spring wind grass next to flowers and cypresses He stood up in support of it You got drunk and left the kingdom alone The chaos of the Day of Judgment arose to watch you Do not be ashamed of your behavior A rebellious cypress that rose to its stature Keep this cloak safe unless you die Katesh rose from the cloak of salus and dignity   Burn Della so that Suz will do things for you Need to repel a hundred plagues in the middle of the night Rebuke the lovely fairy face That a charisma retaliates a hundred times They should wear hijab from the king to his kingdom Whoever serves the World Cup The doctor is the love of my Messiah and the Merciful Lake Chu does not see pain in you to cure it You work with God and have a happy heart If he does not have mercy, he can claim God Luckily, I was bored to wake up Pray at the time of Fateha in the morning Hafez did not burn and did not smell like Zelf Yar Unless the meaning of this government is Saba   Della, good luck, good luck travel companion.  The breeze of Shiraz shrine is enough for you Do not travel to Janan's house anymore, Darwish That is enough spiritual journey and the corner of your monastery And if ambush opens sorrow from the corner of the heart Enough of the privacy of Pir Moghan Sit at the top of the stove and drink Saghar That is enough to gain wealth and space from the world Make things easy for yourself Explicitly, Lal and Betty Choo Maht Enough Give the sky to ignorant people You, the people of grace and knowledge, have enough of this sin The air of the house of the author and the Old Testament Excuse me for traveling Do not be accustomed to others in two worlds Satisfaction of God and reward of the kingdom is enough There is no need for another word, Hafiz Enough midnight prayer and morning lessons   Delbar went and did not inform the loved ones Remember the city opponent and comrade did not travel Or my luck dropped through Marwat Or he did not cross the highway I said unless I was kind to his crying heart Because it was hard, it did not affect his heart Do not joke that my restless heart chicken The longing for a love trap did not go away Everyone who saw you kissed my eyes What he did did not leave me indifferent I stand to do it, John Fada Chou candle He did not pass us the morning breeze   My heart can take no other way than the seal of fog I give him every thought, but he does not take it O God, O counselor of the Saghar hadith Which does not play a role in our imagination better than this Come, bartender, bring a colorful wind That thought inside us does not get better than this I openly hide and people seem to be in the office Surprisingly, the fire does not burn in the office I want this marquee to burn one day The old seller does not take it for granted That's why Safa is loved by his friends Which does not play a role other than the truth His head and eyes are so beautiful, it is as if you take your eyes off him Go Cain does not keep my meaningless sermon Rendan's advisor, who is at war with the verdict I miss him very much, but he does not take Saghar I laugh in tears, like a candle in this house My tongue is fiery but it does not catch How nice of you to make me drunk That no one gets wild birds better than this The word is in our need and the deprivation of the beloved What is the benefit of enchanting the heart that does not take in the heart I will take that mirror one day If it does, it will not catch fire for a while May God have mercy on the Kuwaiti dervishes Dari no longer knows he will not take another path I am amazed by this sweeter poem of the emperor Why doesn't he cover Hafez from head to toe?   I'm heartbroken and unaware I am a dervish What happened to that confused hunter? I tremble over my faith That the heart is in the hand of the eyebrow bow of the infidel The boredom of the sea cooks the staff What is at the head of this inconceivable drop Let me make that comfy eyelash remover Which ripples, drinking water on the sting Thousands of blood dripped from the sleeves of doctors Warm to hand experience on the heart of the beard I went to the alley crying and wandering Because I am ashamed of my product Neither Omar Khedr nor King Alexander remain A quarrel over a world without a dervish It does not reach the waist of every beggar's hand A treasury more than the treasure of Qarun   I'm heartbroken, Lolly, and so excited Lying promises and fighting lay and colorful Sacrifice the shirt of the embroidered moon A thousand garments of piety and abstinence I will take your mole to the ground with me That until my mole becomes dusty The angel of love does not know what you are, butler Ask for cups and pears in fine soil I put the cup on my shroud until dawn I will take you to the heart of the Day of Judgment Poor and tired, I came to you, Rahmi There is no pendant except your guardian Come on, Hatef told me about the shower Be in the position of Reza and avoid irony There is no barrier between lover and beloved Get rid of Hafiz in your own hijab  A heart that is a fortune teller and has a jam What sorrow does Khatami have when he loses his breath?

To speak to the soul is asexual torment Unless the sip squeezed Janan's lips on me I have lived in a pub for many years I forgot about my long service O morning breeze, remember the Old Testament One hundred years later if you pass over my soil The head of the great dancers of Ramim Beloved of us to the hundred hopes of the first heart Apparently, the covenant should not be forgotten by the noble people Do not be discouraged from budding In the morning, help find and breathe the breeze Think of your own recovery from another door Do not fall in love with pain to be treated wisely The gem of knowledge to take with you Which is the share of others, the installer of gold and wire The trap is hard unless it is a friend, by the grace of God We are not a frugal enemy of the regime Hafez is not a wire and gold, what happened, be thankful What thanks to the government for the kind words and temperament  's thought is that the flower became Yaresh Flower in the thought that because he flirts in his work Not everyone is charmed to fall in love The eunuch is to be the sorrow of his servant It is the place where blood ripples in Lal's heart Saddle of Taghaban breaking the market The nightingale learned no from the grace of the flower All these promises and sonnets are embedded in his beak You are passing in the alley of our mistress Beware of breaking its wall He has traveled with a hundred caravans Wherever he is, God bless him Talk about your well-being, even if you like it On the side of love is dear A happy Sufi who tilted his hat Be confused by two other cups Hafez's heart that was happy to see you Nazparvard is a carpenter   Killing this tired man with your sword was not destiny No, nothing was wrong with your ruthless heart I was crazy to leave you alone I was no more worthy than a chain link Or what is the essence of this mirror of Hassan In him, oh, I was not strong I return to the pubs with regret Because you were not an old man in the monastery Sweeter than strength did not grow on the grass It was no better than your role in the world of images Until I reach your place like Saba again The result of the shower was nothing but a nightmare I drew it from you, O fire of shame, like a candle There was no plan in you except my own destruction Ayati was tormented by Hafez without you Which did not need to be interpreted by anyone  I swear by the majesty and glory of the brave king That is not a quarrel with Kasem for any reason Enough of my house wine Bade's opponent, comrade, repent and say goodbye Cloak God to me I do not hear the smell of this situation See the dancers go to the harp Someone who did not give permission to listen to the hearing Look at the lovers thanks to this blessing That I am the obedient slave in the obedient king We are thirsty for the grace of your cup, but We do not dare, we do not give sound Do not separate the forehead and face of God From the soil of the brave king's cobra barge   Writing the story of Shoghi and Madki Baki Come on, I came to life without you, sad I have often said that I was thrilled to see two of them Are the houses Selmi Fine Selmak Strange incident and strange incident Anna is the killer and the killer of the plaintiff When it comes to the flaw of the envelope skirt That is like a drop that drips on a flower leaf From the soil of your feet gave water on tulips and flowers Choo tricked the industry into blue and earth Saba Abirfshan Patrol Saqia Arise And hot sun cream The prayer of revenge is the loss of Jerry like Who is the birthplace of the corridor of chastity and agility There is no effect from me without your image, yes Yes, it is effective How to speak well in Hafez Which is such a divine craft beyond perception   Make charcoal and break the witch market Break the sorrow of Samaritan prosperity and honor To the wind ten heads and the world order means Break the corner hat to the ritual of servitude Put a rite of passage on your forehead Tell sorrow to break the heart of oppression Come out and tiger a good ball from everyone Punish the whore Look at the deer in the sun Break Jupiter into two eyebrows When perfume becomes lavender blossom from the wind Break the price on the price of amber Chou Andalib eloquence sells Hafez Break down the door for him to speak   There is no one who has fallen Who is passing by who is not a calamity? Because your eyes take heart from the hermits Being with you is not on our side On you except the mirror of divine grace It really is so and it is not in this hypocrisy Narges demands the style of your eyes The poor are not ashamed of the news God forbid that you kill us It is not night that a hundred cars are not with Saba wind Come back, you heartless candle There is no effect of light and purity in the opponents' party The treatment of strangers is the effect of mentioning Jamil Jana, is this not the rule in your city? It was December and I said Sanma Ahd instead of R. Khajeh's mistake is not fulfilled in this covenant What difference does it make if Pir Moghan became my mentor There is no secret that is not the secret of God What a lover if he does not take the burden of blame There is no iron shield with any hero In an ascetic monastery and in Sufi solitude There is no altar of prayer except the corner of your eyebrow O claw immersed in the blood of Hafez's heart Thought is nothing but the zeal of the Qur'an and God   Someone who considers Hassan and Khat a friend The researcher is that he has the product of vision Chou Khameh obeyed his command We put it unless he takes the razor Someone found a butterfly to connect you like a candle Which has another head under each razor The kiss reached the hand of someone who he Chou Astana has this in mind forever Where is the pure wind from my dry asceticism? Which smells like a constantly blowing nose If you have nothing, it's not enough for you Demi is tempted by the ignorant intellect One who does not step out of piety He is determined to travel now Hafez will break his broken heart Chou Laleh is hot air on the liver  The black trick on the day he remembers us Take the reward of two hundred slaves to set free The messenger of a healthy house, whose health is good What if it makes our hearts happy Try to give me a lot of treasure If you are ruined, your grace will make me happy Or the paste in the heart of that sweet Khosrow To have mercy on Farhad The king was of hundred years of obedience and asceticism The value of one hour of life in him Now your sweet flirtation has taken over my foundation What a wise foundation Your pure gem is beyond our comprehension What to think about Hassan Khodadad We did not reach our destination in Shiraz Khorram on the day that Hafiz travels to Baghdad   By the water and the feet of the willow and the nature of poetry and good help Sweet sweetheart companion and happy butler Unless you are a fortune teller who appreciates time Guevara, I wish you a happy day Everyone who is in love with love Sepandi Go is on fire, not having a good job I adorn the bride of nature with a pristine thought I was able to get my hands on a nice painting The night of the booty talk and the shout of happiness Which is a heartwarming moonlight and a happy lament May is in the bowl of the eye to kiss the butler Which intoxicates the intellect and gives a pleasant hangover Omar neglected Hafez, come to the pub with us That the well-to-do Shengols learn is a good thing   Now that the wind on the floor of the cup is flat It is described in hundreds of thousands of languages Ask for a poetry book and a desert road When is school and talk about discovery? The jurist of the school was drunk and issued a fatwa Which is forbidden but belongs to the endowment You are not sentenced to pain and smoothness Whatever our butler did is the same as Altaf Take the analogy of the people and the people That is the situation of the hermits from head to toe The hadith of the claimants and the imagination of their colleagues The same is the story of Zarduz and Boryabaf Silence of Hafez and these things like red gold Keep in mind that the hook of the city is money changers   Now that flowers have come out of nowhere on the grass Banafsheh prostrated at his feet Drink the morning cup to the moan of the daf and the harp Kiss the butler's chin to the tune of reeds and incense Around the flower, sit without wine and witness and grab Which was such a week of survival a few weeks The sky was clear from the departure of Riyahin Chou Earth to the star of the monkey and the horoscope of Massoud From the thin hand of the witness Jesus's mourning Drink wine and leave the hadith of Aad and Thamud Chow Khald Brin's world was surrounded by lilies and flowers But what a benefit it may not be Chou Gol rides in the air like Solomon At dawn when the chicken comes to David's song Refresh the garden with Zoroastrianism Now that the tulip is lit, the fire does not go out Ask for a morning cup in memory of Asef Ahd Minister King Suleiman Emad Din Mahmoud It was that Hafez Assembly trained him in Yemen Whatever the sentence requires is available   Now that the breeze of heaven is blowing from the park Me and the refreshing wine and the sweetheart Why not beg the king today Which is the tent of the shadow of the cloud, and Bazmgeh killed his lips The grass tells the story of May It is not wise to buy credit and cash in heaven Give the mansion that this world is ruined He intends to make clay out of our soil Loyalty to the enemy that does not radiate Chu lit a candle from a lamp Do not be intoxicated by the black letter of my reproach Who knows what fate wrote on his head Do not hesitate to walk away from Hafez's body Who, though drowning in sin, goes to heaven   He took a message to the kings to beg me Who sell two thousand jams to the dormitory I'm ruined and infamous and I still hope To reach the good name of my loved ones You who sell chemistry, look at our hearts That we have no wealth and we have thrown livestock Wow, Janan's loyalty did not pay attention Not to a message letter, not to a greeting cream If this wine is raw if it is cooked opponent A thousand times better than a thousand cooked raw ز رهم میفکن ای شیخ به سانه های حسبیح When a smart chicken falls, it does not go to any animal At your service, I am buying and selling gracefully When the servant falls less into the bondage of slavery Where do I go to complain to tell this story That was the edge of our lives and you did not last Open the lashes and shed the blood of Hafiz Who does not commit such a deadly revenge   Who motivates more poetry because it is sad We have said one thing about this meaning and that is it I will find a gold ring from your pomegranate One hundred properties of Suleiman are under the jewel One should not be saddened by the jealous sarcasm of the heart Maybe that's why you's good at this Whoever does not understand the saddle is imaginative His role is to portray China as forbidden May and the blood of the heart were each given to someone This is the case in the circle section This was the eternal rule in the work of roses and flowers Cain is witnessing the curtain bath market It is not to make Hafiz Randy for the sake of it Cain has a previous history to the next day   When the soul melts, the work of the heart is finished and not done We burned in this raw dream and failed He told Labeh to go to your house one night I ambushed the slave of my own free will and I could not He announced that he would meet with Rendan Let's name Randy and pain and name it and not If the dove of the heart beats Who saw in his path twisted and twisted and could not Know the desire to kiss that drunken lip What blood fell in my heart like a cup and did not I walk to the place of my love for no reason That I made a hundred efforts and failed Faghan, who is looking for a treasure letter I was ruined by the world of grief and it did not end Regret and pain that attend the treasure hunt I was tired of begging and I could not Hafiz thought a thousand tricks In that lust, the painter was tamed and failed   From this ruined house to the Roman house Where I go wise and prudent Rome Saddle traveler, I will return home safely I vowed to go to the pub on the way To say what I discovered from this journey To the monastery with a barrette and a Roman module Acquaintances love warm blood Naksemgar complains to a foreigner After this, my hand and Zelf Cho Chained A few and a few from the com of the crazy heart of Rome If I see the curve of his altar open I should prostrate and give thanks Khorram is the tail that Cho Hafez owes to the minister I am happy to go to my house with my friend   If it were Omar, I would go to the pub again I do not do any other work except serve Rendan Khorram the day I go crying Until my wife drinks water once more Knowledge is not the cause of God in this people To go your gem to another buyer Yar, if he left and did not know the right to speak for a long time God forbid that I go to another friend The blue wheel circle, if I am comfortable I will get it again to another compass Afit wants me to remember Ghamzeh Shokhsh and that other way of escaping The secret of us being told by hand Every time with daf and straw on the other market Every breath of pain I call the sky every hour I do not intend to bother anyone else I repeat, Hafez is not alone in this incident They drowned in this Bedouin very much   If it rains in that month We have placed the neck of God We also know the religion of piety But what to do with misguided luck We know the sheikh and the preacher less Or the wind cup or a short story I rand and fall in love with the flower season Then repent to God for forgiveness Your seal should not throw a picture at us The mirror of a dream oh from your heart oh Patience and life Or the poetry of Hatam al-Qah Hafiz, what are you complaining about? Blood should be eaten occasionally   Although a knot fell from his neck I still keep my eyes open for the cream Do not carry the red to the cup The blood of the heart gives a picture of my face My curtain will be lost Oh, if Zan is not in this curtain, I will I have become the guardian of the sanctuary of my heart every night To leave nothing but his thoughts on this screen I'm the magician who speaks with magic I get all the sugar from the straw Luckily for him the legend was in a dream I'm waking up with a breeze Because I do not see you in the passage, my friend When I say to say a word to my friend Shower said that Hafiz is all-round and hypocritical Except for the dirt on the door, who was my market?   Although this is not easy for the city preacher So that he will be hypocritical and Salus will not become a Muslim Learn and cream, which is not so much art An animal that does not drink can become a human A pure gem must be graceful Not every stone and mud should not be lol and coral Make your name famous, be happy That he does not become a Muslim by the trick of the devil I love and hope this noble fan Because other arts do not cause deprivation The shower was telling me to give it to you tomorrow God forbid that he does not regret Good mood, I ask God for your temperament So that we are no longer disturbed by you Hafiz did not have the slightest effort Do not want the sun to shine   Although we are the servants of the king The kings of the morning kingdom Treasure in empty sleeves and bags Giti Nema Cup and Rahim Soil Vigilant presence and drunken pride We are drowning in the sea of monotheism Lucky witness because he is charismatic Mung bean mirror face is important The king wakes up lucky every night We are the guardian of the officer and the head Go spoil our talk That you are in a dream and we see you Shah Mansour knows that we Strive to wherever we are Cover the enemies with blood Conquer friends The color of hypocrisy was not before us Red lion and black snake Hafiz loan Tell them to pay back You have confessed and we are witnessing   If the hand touches the soil, I will write Let me draw a line of dust on the visual plate I was overwhelmed by the smell of you, I am overwhelmed with hope From the wave of my head that came to me His butterfly if I arrived in search of life Because I blow out the candle at the same time Suction my loyalty and thought today The night before I stopped praying out of grief Your black zulfin to the comfort of lovers They decided to take me O wind, bring me a breeze from that wind It smelled like healing If my heart does not touch my dear friend I can see the fluent criticism in his tail Mufshan skirt of me dirt that after me Saddle can not take the wind away my dust Hafiz Lab Lalsh Choo is my dear soul Omi was the moment when I put my soul on my lips   If it reaches your head, I'll be back Because you say what heads I return to your polo Your life is long, but it is not I have long hair in my hand Give me a comfortable butterfly candle tonight I will burn like a candle from the fire of my heart before you That's to give a tenth laugh John Chou explicitly Mastan, I want you to pray Because my prayer is not contaminated with prayer Do not reduce the heat in the pond Imagination in the mosque and pub I will make an altar and a fiddle from your two eyebrows If you make our privacy one night Because I will fly to the horizons of the world in the morning Mahmoud was the end of the work in this way If it goes away, I will sigh Hafiz sad heart to say that in this round Except for the cup, which was Muharram Razm   If you make a mistake, it will go away Your Hinduism persecuted us Electricity love the harvest of fuel wool fuel The kind of Shah Kamrangar went on begging Do not bring resentment in the way Every turbidity that you saw went away like purity Lovemaking must be endured, O steadfast heart If it was Malala, and if it was a mistake, it went away If the heart of a consolation's sorrow wins There was an adventure between Jan and Janan Boredom arose from the speakers, but If there was insults among the companions Do not blame the preacher who left the monastery Che's freedom went somewhere   What if I pick a fruit from your garden? Let me see what happens in front of your lamp Or paste in the hemp shade of that tall cypress What if I sit burned for a while? Finally, Khatam Jamshid Homayoun What if I do not see your photo on the role? The preacher of the city of Cho chose the seal of Malik and Shahna What if I choose a stamp? My mind wanders from home and this is it I saw in advance what would happen in my religion house Spent expensive life to the mistress and May What happens to me, what happens to me The eunuch knew that I was in love and said nothing Hafiz also knows what will happen to me   If I think of blaming the plaintiffs Do not miss the way drunk and randy The asceticism of the newly learned Rendan is the way to go What good is it for me to be infamous in my world? The tumultuous king of my chaotic leaders Zan to be in the least wisdom of the whole world Play on the forehead, empty of the blood of my heart That they may know that I am your disbeliever Believe and forgive God So that you do not know how rare I am in this cloak My bloody poem, O wind, bring it to me I did not die from black eyelashes on my veins What do I do with anyone if I eat? Keep my secret and the mystic of my time   If you sell, Rendan's needs will be met. May God forgive and repel evil Give the butler a cup of justice to the beggar He was not zealous to make the world prosperous The good news of this sorrow will reach the good news If a seeker fulfills the promise of trust If suffering occurs and if comfort is wise Do not attribute anything other than these, God willing In a factory that is not the path of wisdom and grace Poor understanding of prying vote why Make a curtain so that no one dies without delay Van Koo does not make this song a mistake He killed us with the pain of love and the scourge of addiction Either connect a friend or filter it John went in May and Hafez fell in love Where is Jesus to revive us?   Get rid of the heat to sit with the consolation I drink from the connected cup, I pick flowers from the garden The bitter Sufi wine of my foundation wants to win My lips are on my lips, no, butler, and my sweet soul But I will go crazy in this soda that night to day I talk to the moon, I dream of a fairy He gave sugar to Mastan and looked at you I am the end of deprivation, neither with it nor with this Whenever the wind blows, it takes a bounty Remind me that I am a long-time servant Not everyone who plays a regular role will find his words pleasant I take my side, which is agile, my hawk If you do not believe, ask the Chinese painter That Mani version wants from the tip of the black trick Loyalty and honesty are not everyone's business غلام عصف ثانی جلال الحق و الدینم Hear the secrets of drunkenness and Randy from me, not from the preacher That we do not see the moon and Parvin with a cup and a cup every time  said you went out to watch the new moon Shame on you from the eyebrows It is life to the heart of our captives Do not neglect to protect the side of your friends Sell the perfume of wisdom to our Hindu Zulf There are a thousand black navels in the middle of the atmosphere The seeds of fidelity and love in this old slaughterhouse It should be revealed that it was the harvest season Bring a butler to tell you the code From the old stars of garlic and the new moon The shape of the crescent shows each fog From Siamak officer and leave Zhu's hat Hafiz, Mr. Pir Moghan, is faithful Read the lesson of the hadith of love on him and listen to him  I said, O good king, have mercy on this stranger He said to follow the heart of the poor poor stranger I told him not to pass the time he said excuse me What a flourishing house of sorrow What a pity for sleeping on a cute royal squirrel Thorns and thorns make a strange bed and bed O which is the place of several acquaintances in the chain of zeal Good luck with that black spot on the face of a strange color The photo looks in color on the fog Like a purple leaf on Nasrin Gharib's page It's so weird that it's a round line Although there was no strange black line in the gallery I said, O strangers, you's shy. Beware in the morning, because this stranger is born Said Hafez, the acquaintances are in a state of astonishment He was not far away, sitting tired and poor, strange   I said, 'I'm sad.' I told him to show me the moon if he came I told him to learn the tradition of fidelity from Mehrvarzan There is less talk of good deeds I said to look at the imagination He said that it was night and he would come the other way I said that the smell of greed misled my world He said that if you know, the leader will come in August I said, Blessed is the wind in the morning. Said cool breeze come to love I said that Noush killed us for wish I told you to be a slave and to be a servant I said that the heart of mercy is determined to make peace Do not talk to anyone until it is time I said you saw the time of Ishrat when it came to an end Hafez Kain said, Silence will come.   I told them to open Kamran's mouth and lips You told them to do so with the eyes of whatever you say I said that Egypt's tribute is asking for you They said to lose less in this deal I said to the point of your mouth that went away He said that this is an anecdote to be noted I told Sanamparast not to sit with Samad Tell them to do both this and that I said the air is getting sad from the heart Good luck to those who make their hearts happy I said wine and cloak are not a religion He said that this practice should be practiced by the old religion I said, What's the use of drinking old lips? He said to rejuvenate her with a kiss of thanks I said when will Khajeh go to the cell? Said when Jupiter and May recite the Qur'an I said that the prayer of his government is the word of Hafiz Said this prayer to the angels of the seven heavens  The creators said that you are Yusuf Thani Because I saw the truth Sweeter than instant thank you O Khosrow, good that you are in a sweet time Your mouth cannot be compared to a bud There was never a bud so tight in the mouth Tell me a hundred times that I have ten teeth in your mouth Because Susan is free, why a linguistic sentence It 's as if I'm going to close Comet and Janet Do not be afraid Your owl's eyes passed through the shield of life A patient who has seen such a hard bow Because you make people cry Take it for granted   The faceless flower is not pleasant. Spring is not windless The side of the grass and the circumambulation Don't be happy without a tulip Cedar dancing and flower mode Do not be silent without a thousand With the sweetheart's sweetheart Do not be kissless and happy Any role that closes the mind Except for the painter John is a humble critic of Hafez Do not be happy   Flowers are on the floor and the lover is on the palate The king of my world is a slave to such a day You bring candles to this gathering tonight In our parliament, the moon is a friend In our religion, wind is lawful, but Without you, the flower of the limbs is forbidden Everyone listens to the words of the reed and the melody My eyes are all on the lipstick and the rotation of the cup In our house the perfume that makes us Every moment of your hair is fragrant Do not say anything about sugar and sugar The pain that comes from my sweet lips Until the treasure of sorrow dwells in the ruined heart I have always been the abode of ruin Out of shame, as if my name is shame And what name do you ask that I am ashamed of? He eats and is confused and we run and he is open-minded Who is not one of us in this city? Do not say that he's wrong with me We are constantly looking for luxury Hafiz is a stubborn and beloved lover Kayam is a flower and jasmine and Eid al-Adha   Mask the petals of black lavender It means to face and ruin the world Sweat sweat from the face and around the garden Because our seen glasses are full of flowers The days of Gol Cho Omar hastened to go Hurry butler around the rosy wind Open the drunken sleeping narcissus style And sleep from the envy of Narges Rana's eyes Hear the smell of violet and catch the scorpion Look at the color of tulips and the determination of wine Where is the custom and habit of falling in love with you Fight with the enemies and rebuke us Like a bubble seen on a cup opener Compare Wayne's house to the base of the bubble Hafiz Vesal asks for prayer Or answer the prayer of the weary heart   Golben Eish is blowing the butler of Gol-e-Azar Ko The spring wind blows the pleasant wind Every new flower remembers a rose, but Listen, where did you see the credit? Majlis Bazm Eish is not meant as a rug Oh, good morning, Nafe Zelf Yar Ko Good selling is not my tolerance, Saba I touched the blood of my heart for God's sake A magic candle if you brag about it The enemy stretched out his tongue juicy dagger He said, Do you wish you could not kiss me? People have this desire, but power and authority Although Hafez is the treasure of wisdom in the words of the capacitor Talk about the sadness of the times   Suffering from Golestan is enough for our world The saddle of the grass is the shadow of our cypress tree Far be it from me to talk to a hypocrite Enough of the expensive world Ferdows Palace will be rewarded Enough of us who ran and beggars late Sit on the edge of the atmosphere and watch life pass Enough of Cain pointing to our worldview Look at the world market critique and harass the world If you do not have enough, this will be enough for us Dear friend, what need do we have to ask for more? The government is enough to talk to us Send God to my door from heaven That your head is enough for us and our place Hafez is an unfair part of the herd Enough of our flowing water and lyric poems   The gem of the repository of secrets is the same as it was The trick is to seal it and show that it was Lovers are among the trustees Inevitably, Goharbar's eye is what it used to be Ask Saba to take us all night until dawn The smell of your hair is the same as Mons John He does not seek pomegranate, otherwise he is the sun It was still in the practice of mining and mining Find your sorrowful pilgrimage Zan, who was as poor as he was worried The color of our heart that you hide It is still evident in your lips I told you not to let go anymore Years went by and it was like that Memorize the story of the bloody eyes Which is the same running water on this spring   I kiss her lips and knock on the door I have taken to the water of life No secret I can tell anyone I can not see anyone with him He kisses her lips and eats blood Rakhsh sees and flowers temperament Give me a cup and don't forget the jam Who knows who Jam was and who Ki was Go to the curtain of the moon Burn his veins so that I can bite him He brought flowers from solitude to the garden Asceticism is like a bud Do not make drunk eyes drunk Remember Lalsh, the butler Do not ask John for separation from that mold That is, the blood of the cup in the veins and p Understand your language, Hafiz Zamani Hear the hadith of the speechless from the straw   Lal is watered with blood on the lips of my friend Seeing him is my life Shame on those black windy eyes and long eyelashes Whoever saw his heartbreak and denies me Sarwan went to the gated gate of Sar Koo It is a highway that is my beloved home My fortune teller who is faithful in this famine That love is my intoxicated Loli buyer Drum, the perfume of the flowers and the scent of its flowers Grace is a scent of my fragrance The gardener is like a breeze in me Kabar Golzar To is from the tears of Cho Golnar Sugar and rose syrup came from my lips Narges is the doctor who is my sick heart The one who taught Hafiz the point in the style of lyric poetry Sweet talk is a rare word of mine   We have tried our luck in this city You have to get out of this abyss Enough to touch and sigh I set fire to my naked body What a pleasure it is for me to sing The flower spreads its ears from the branch of its tree Kai, be happy in your heart that that hot friend Sit very hard on your luck You want the hard and weak world to pass over you Forgive your weak promises and hard words It's time to dump her and move on I set fire to all my clothes and cooking O Hafiz, you have always been available Jamshid also did not stay away from his bed   We have come to this in pursuit of greatness We have taken refuge here from a bad accident On the way to the house of our love and on the border of nothingness We have come all the way to the climate of existence We saw the green of your line and from the garden of paradise We have come to the credit of this seal With such a treasure that became his capacitor Amin Spirit We have come to the king's house as beggars Where is the anchor of your dream, the ship of success? That we have come into this sea of worms drowning in sin Shame on you, O cloud of error We have come to the black court Hafiz throws this woolen cloak that we We came after the caravan with fire   We have lost a drunken heart We are with love and with the cup We have been blamed a lot We have opened our eyes to our work O flower, you have taken a hot morning shower We are the anemones we are born with Pir Moghan was bored with our repentance Make it clear that we are standing for an excuse The work goes away from you, you are the reason for the journey We make money and we are on our way Because Laleh shows and cups in the middle of work It's hot in our bloody hearts You said that Hafiz is so colorful and imaginative The wrong role indicates that we are the same simple tablet   We put the morning lesson in the pub We put the product of prayer in the path of the soul In the harvest of a hundred ascetic wise fire It's hot that we put on a crazy heart Sultan Azal gave us the treasure of love We left this house in ruins I do not want to betray you in this heart We sealed his lips in this house There can be no more hypocrites in the cloak We laid the foundation of this method Because this ship goes astray, that's the end We put a seed on the head of that gem God bless us for being heartless and religious We called it wise and prudent We were satisfied with your imagination, Chou Hafez Or Lord, what anguish and alienation we have made   What do you think of the fear of wine? Bend the head that the mug is broken If Khmer is heavenly, pour that friendless Every syrup of my torment that giving is the same as torment Alas, he became sweet and cried when he saw her His calligraphy is a role on water You woke up and saw that you could not be safe Saddle my daughter-in-law who is sleeping in this house The lover is obvious to you, but Aghiar is a mask from that package He saw flowers on your colorful face thanks to sweat In the fire of passion, the rose is drowned in sorrow It is green in the plains and let us not leave The hand of the blue head that the world is a mirage sentence In the corner of my nose is a piece of advice Cain Corner is full of whispers and harps What happened to Hafez, he is in love and Rand is open-minded Surprisingly, the days of Shabab are necessary   We had eye help What we thought was wrong To give a tree friendship Now we went and planted an egg Dialogue was not a Dervish religion No, we had adventures with you The way your eyes were deceived by the war We made a mistake and thought peace Golben Hassan did not become a delirium We worked hard for him The tips went away and no one complained We sided with the sanctity He said, You gave yourself to our heart. We did not appoint a student   We will go out one night and pray Let's grieve your grief somewhere My heart became sick at the hands of Madadi's comrades Let's go to his doctor and take medicine The one who got angry and hit me with a razor and left Open God to purify us It is dry. Where is the road to ruin? So that we do not show up in that weather Help is not for the sake of the reindeer The work is difficult so that we do not make a mistake Do not let the shadow of the bird do not bother you Ask for the shadow of a monkey Where is Hafez Khoshgooi?
